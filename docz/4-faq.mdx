# FAQ

## Software

### Where do I download the wallet software?

Zepio is available to download from the Zcash Foundation GitHub repository. The releases page lists the latest available downloads for each platform.

### Which version of Zepio should I download?

You should always aim to stay at the latest stable build. See the [installation](http://changeme.com) section for more details.

### How do I verify the download file?

Starting from v0.6.0 all Zepio releases are signed. You may download the detached signatures on the releases page and verify that the software was signed with the published public key. In addition, each release contains SHA256 checksums that may additionally be verified.

## Zcash

### Is Zepio a light client?

No, Zepio requires a full `zcashd` node in order to operate. A light client protocol is currently in development that would substantially reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for a light wallet. Currently, to use shielded transactions, you need to run a full node. Zepio has a built-in `zcashd` node, but it will also play well with your custom `zcashd` setup.

### How large is the Zcash blockchain data?

Currently, the blockchain data directory is around 27GB (May 2019) and will continue to grow over time.

### Can I use a custom fee?

Yes. It is advised to maintain the default `0.0001 ZEC` fee to prevent your transactions from being distinguishable. However, you can find the custom fee picker inside of the Advanced Options on the Send view.

### What’s the difference between Transparent, Sprout and Sapling addresses?

Transparent addresses start with a `t` prefix and are just like Bitcoin addresses, offering no privacy properties. Sprout addresses have a `zc` prefix and are the first generation of Zcash shielded addresses. Sprout addresses have been superseded by Sapling addresses which have a `zs` prefix. While Sprout addresses may still be used, it is recommended to use Sapling addresses due to the performance improvements and updated system parameters.

> Note that on testnet, transparent addresses have a prefix `tm`, Sprout have a `zt` prefix and Sapling `ztestsapling`.

### How long does a Sapling transaction take?

Sapling greatly reduced the time taken to perform shielded proofs down to just a few seconds though this value does depend on hardware and the number of shielded inputs/outputs. Sending from a transparent address to a Sapling one is typically completed in under 0.5 seconds. Legacy Sprout transactions take in the order of 70-90 seconds but this is also dependent on hardware and the number of JoinSplits.

### Where is the default data directory on each platform?

By default, the location of the data directory, which stores the wallet, zcash.conf and all blockchain data, is found in the following locations. It is possible to move this data directory.

* Windows: %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Zcash
* macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash
* Linux: ~/.zcash

### Where is zcash.conf located?

zcash.conf is located in the default data directory and will be in this location even if the datadir parameter has been set to a custom value.

### Can I use ZecWallet with an external node?

Yes.

## Transactions

### Does ZecWallet work on testnet?

Yes, ZecWallet will work on testnet. To do so add the following lines to your zcash.conf file, replacing the existing values if present:

### Does ZecWallet support payment disclosure?

Not yet. While payment disclosure works on Sprout addresses, zcashd has not yet been updated to support Sapling. There is a plan to support this once implemented by zcashd.

### Does ZecWallet support viewing keys?

Not yet, as zcashd doesn’t currently support Sapling viewing keys and will be implemented in ZecWallet once supported

### Is the wallet encrypted?

No, wallet encryption is currently disabled by zcashd. You should use full-disk encryption (or encryption of your home directory) to protect your wallet.dat file at rest, and should assume (even unprivileged) users who are running on your OS can read your wallet.dat file.

### Why does my change go to a new address?

Like Bitcoin, when using transparent addresses, change from a transaction goes to a new transparent address. ZecWallet allows you to set an option to automatically send this change to a Sapling address via the application Options. As the ‘feature’ was added in Bitcoin as a measure to preserve privacy and prevent trivial linking of transactions on the blockchain, shielded (z) addresses do not have this property and any change is returned to the sending (z) address by default.

### Will ZecWallet remember my outgoing shielded sends?

Yes, by default ZecWallet will store shielded sends locally as zcashd does not provide this information. You can override this behaviour via the Options setting and you can remove any stored transactions at any time by choosing the Clear History button (note that these will not be later recoverable if you delete them).

## Node

### Can I use ZecWallet with a hardware wallet?

No, this is currently not supported.

### Can I remove an address from the wallet?

No, addresses cannot be removed from the wallet. It is advised that you export the private keys for addresses you are interested in and then delete the wallet.dat file. You can then import the private keys you require in a fresh, empty wallet.
