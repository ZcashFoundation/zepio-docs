# Getting Started

## Dashboard

<Image src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrerfneves/zepio-docs/develop/docz/assets/dashboard.png' />

**Zepio**'s Dashboard is the entry point of the application. This is where a user can get an overview of the latest state and updates to the wallet. More specifically, a user is faced with the following when inside of the Dashboard:
  * Overview of the balance of coins available for spending (`shielded` and `transparent`).
  * Overview of the USD-denominated value of the funds.
  * Chronological list of the most recent transactions performed within the wallet.
  * Details of a specific transaction.
  * Network base chain (`mainnet` or `testnet`).
  * Full node daemon status (`built-in` or `custom`).
  * Network synchronization status pill (`ready`, `syncing`, `error`).

## Send

<Image src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrerfneves/zepio-docs/develop/docz/assets/send.png' />

The Send view provides an easy way to send ZEC to any other Zcash address. To the right is an overview of the transaction being created, and to the right you will find a smart form. To begin, select a source address to send ZEC from -- the selector shows all available addresses and their respective funds.

Next, select a ZEC amount that you wish to send. Use the arrow to the right of the input if you wish to send all of the funds available in that address.

The next field is the Zcash address the funds are being sent to. It's a smart input, so all addresses pasted are checked for validity. You will see either `VALID` or `INVALID` to the right of the input -- you won't be able to submit a transaction to an address that does not validate. If sending to a shielded address, the user will also be shown a memo field that accepts either HEX or ASCII formatting.

It is advised to use the `default` fee of 0.0001 ZEC to refrain from having your transactions distinguised from the rest. That being said, if you'd like to send a transaction with a specific transaction fee, just use the `Show Additional Options` toggler. Low, medium, and high amounts are proposed, but you are also able to enter a custom ZEC value.

## Receive

The Receive view provides information about all addresses in the wallet. For complete privacy on your transactions, make sure to use shielded addresses (start with `zs`). Transparent addresses, which provide no privacy capabiltiies, are available inside `Show Other Address Types`. You are able to generate as many addresses as needed, both shielded and transaparent addresses.

Clicking on the address item itself will present you with a QR code and more details about the address, such as address and available funds. Along with the copy address buttons, you are just 1 to 2 clicks away from receiving funds.

## Transactions

## Transaction Details

## Settings

The Settings view provides options to further configure **Zepio** for your own specific wants and needs. The following actions are possible inside of the Settings view:
  * Change between `mainnet` and `testnet` Zcash chains.
  * Toggle between `Light` and `Dark` **Zepio** themes.
  * Import and export address-specific private keys.
  * Backup `wallet.dat` file.

## Console

<Image src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrerfneves/zepio-docs/develop/docz/assets/console.png' />

The Console view displays the information from the built-in `zcashd` full node. It provides further insights into the status of the embedded node such as block height, network solution rate, and number of connections. It also details the longevity of the running node process.

In case you run into any synchronization issues, the Console is a good place to start getting more details.

> Please note that if you are running your own `zcashd` full node, **Zepio** will not display the Console view.
