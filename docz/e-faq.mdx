# FAQ

Your privacy is important to us. It is ZecWallet’s policy to completely respect your privacy regarding any information.

## Where do I download the software?

Zepio is available to download from the Zcash Foundation GitHub repository. The releases page lists the latest available downloads for each platform.

## Which version should I download?

See the installation section for more details specific for your platform.

## How do I verify the download file?

Starting from v0.5.10 all ZecWallet releases are signed. You may download the detached signatures on the releases page and verify that the software was signed with the published public key. In addition, each release contains SHA256 checksums that may additionally be verified. For more information, see the Verifying the download section of the Installation guide.

## Is ZecWallet a light client?

No, ZecWallet requires a full zcashd node to operate. A light client protocol is currently in development that would substantially reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for a light wallet. Currently, to use shielded transactions, you need to run a full node.

## How large is the blockchain?

Currently, the blockchain data directory is around 22GB (Feb 2019) and will continue to grow over time.

## Can I change the location of the data directory?

If you are starting ZecWallet for the first time, then you can choose the Advanced Config option and select the desired location of your data directory, which may, for example, be on a separate disk.

## Can I use a custom fee?

Yes, though it is advised to use the default 0.0001 fee to prevent your transactions from being distinguishable, you may override this behaviour in the app Options

## What’s the difference between Transparent, Sprout and Sapling addresses?

Transparent addresses start with a t prefix and are transparent like Bitcoin and offer no privacy properties. Sprout addresses have a zc prefix and are the first generation of shielded addresses. Sprout addresses have been superseded by Sapling addresses which have a zs prefix. While Sprout addresses may still be used, it is recommended to use Sapling addresses due to the performance improvements and updated system parameters. To move funds between Sprout and Sapling addresses see the turnstile migration documentation. For more detailed information on the types of addresses in Zcash see this page.

Note that on testnet, transparent addresses have a prefix tm, Sprout have a zt prefix and Sapling ztestsapling.

## How long does a Sapling transaction take?

Sapling greatly reduced the time taken to perform shielded proofs down to just a few seconds though this value does depend on hardware and the number of shielded inputs/outputs. Sending from a transparent address to a Sapling one is typically completed in under 0.5 seconds. Legacy Sprout transactions take in the order of 70-90 seconds but this is also dependent on hardware and the number of JoinSplits. For more information see this post.

## Where is the default data directory on each platform?

By default, the location of the data directory, which stores the wallet, zcash.conf and all blockchain data, is found in the following locations. It is possible to move this data directory.

* Windows: %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Zcash
* macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash
* Linux: ~/.zcash

## Where is zcash.conf located?

zcash.conf is located in the default data directory and will be in this location even if the datadir parameter has been set to a custom value.

## Can I use ZecWallet with an external node?

Yes, see this section for how to connect to an external zcashd.

## Does ZecWallet work on testnet?

Yes, ZecWallet will work on testnet. To do so add the following lines to your zcash.conf file, replacing the existing values if present:

## Does ZecWallet support payment disclosure?

Not yet. While payment disclosure works on Sprout addresses, zcashd has not yet been updated to support Sapling. There is a plan to support this once implemented by zcashd.

## Does ZecWallet support viewing keys?

Not yet, as zcashd doesn’t currently support Sapling viewing keys and will be implemented in ZecWallet once supported

## Is the wallet encrypted?

No, wallet encryption is currently disabled by zcashd. You should use full-disk encryption (or encryption of your home directory) to protect your wallet.dat file at rest, and should assume (even unprivileged) users who are running on your OS can read your wallet.dat file.

## Why does my change go to a new address?

Like Bitcoin, when using transparent addresses, change from a transaction goes to a new transparent address. ZecWallet allows you to set an option to automatically send this change to a Sapling address via the application Options. As the ‘feature’ was added in Bitcoin as a measure to preserve privacy and prevent trivial linking of transactions on the blockchain, shielded (z) addresses do not have this property and any change is returned to the sending (z) address by default.

## Will ZecWallet remember my outgoing shielded sends?

Yes, by default ZecWallet will store shielded sends locally as zcashd does not provide this information. You can override this behaviour via the Options setting and you can remove any stored transactions at any time by choosing the Clear History button (note that these will not be later recoverable if you delete them).

## Can I use ZecWallet with a hardware wallet?

No, this is currently not supported.

## Can I remove an address from the wallet?

No, addresses cannot be removed from the wallet. It is advised that you export the private keys for addresses you are interested in and then delete the wallet.dat file. You can then import the private keys you require in a fresh, empty wallet.
