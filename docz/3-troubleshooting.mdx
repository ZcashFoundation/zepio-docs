# Troubleshooting

Please read the error cases below to attempt resolving your issues. If your issue is not resolved by reading any of the troubleshooting answers, please file a GitHub issue.

The debug.log file is the first place to start for troubleshooting issues. The file is located in the data directory and by default is found in the following locations:

> `Windows: %HOMEPATH%/AppData/Roaming/Zcash/debug.log`

> `macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash/debug.log`

> `Linux: ~/.zcash/debug.log`

If you have specified a custom `datadir` option then the debug.log file will be located in that directory. Using a tool such as tail you can view the last 100 lines with the following command:

`tail -n 100 ~/.zcash/debug.log`

## Stuck on loading screen

This means **Zepio** couldn’t start its embedded `zcashd` full node daemon for some reason. **Zepio** should display the error reported from `the daemon` in the loading screen. You might be able to solve this by simply restarting **Zepio**, but if you repeatedly see this error, it might be one of the following reasons:

> You might have corrupt zcash params: In this case, you may try deleting your params and letting **Zepio** download them again.

If all else fails, you can run an external `zcashd` and **Zepio** will seamlessly connect to it.
