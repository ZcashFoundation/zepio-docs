# Troubleshooting

Please read the error cases below to attempt resolving your issues. If your issue is not resolved by reading any of the troubleshooting answers, please file a GitHub issue.

There are two sets of logs: Zepio logs, and `zcashd` logs. Zepio's logs are located on the paths below and should provide you information from the application's renderer process:

> `Windows: %HOMEPATH%/AppData/Roaming/Zepio/main-process-logs.txt`

> `macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zepio/main-process-logs.txt`

> `Linux: ~/.Zepio/main-process-logs.txt`

The debug.log file is another place to try troubleshooting issues. The file is located in the data directory and by default is found in the following locations:

> `Windows: %HOMEPATH%/AppData/Roaming/Zcash/debug.log`

> `macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Zcash/debug.log`

> `Linux: ~/.zcash/debug.log`

If you have specified a custom `datadir` option then the debug.log file will be located in that directory. Using a tool such as tail you can view the last 100 lines with the following command:

`tail -n 100 ~/.zcash/debug.log`

## Stuck on loading screen

This means **Zepio** couldn’t start its embedded `zcashd` full node daemon for some reason. **Zepio** should display the error reported from `the daemon` in the loading screen. You might be able to solve this by simply restarting **Zepio**, but if you repeatedly see this error, it might be one of the following reasons:

> You might have corrupt zcash params: In this case, you may try deleting your params and letting **Zepio** download them again.

If all else fails, you can run an external `zcashd` and **Zepio** will seamlessly connect to it.
